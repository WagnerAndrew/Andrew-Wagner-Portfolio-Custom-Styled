          <h5>About Me</h5>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a Full Stack Web Developer with previous work experience as an
            audio-visual systems programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm tutoring students, building applications and
            continuing to learn new technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not programming, I'm probably writing songs, debating who's
            the best coffee roaster in town or lost somewhere in the Rockies.
